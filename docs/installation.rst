Installation
============

TRuML requires **Python 2** and **pip**.  The `Anaconda installer <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ is a quick way to obtain
both. Take care to install Python 2.

Installing from PyPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. note::
    This option is not yet available

Simply type the following in a terminal to install TRuML from the Python Package Index:

    :command:`pip install truml`

Installing from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is also possible to install TRuML from source code in a similar fashion.  Simply download or clone the source code
repository and execute the command:

    :command:`pip install -e .`

from the root directory of the source code repository
