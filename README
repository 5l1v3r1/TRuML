A tool to convert between models written in the Kappa and BioNetGen rule-based modeling languages

Caveats:
 - The sets of valid models for each language are not equivalent (there are models in both languages with features that cannot be translated into the other language)
 - This tool considers BNGL models to be written with NFsim-compatible syntax
   (e.g. product molecularity is ignored)
 - Kappa perturbation language and BNGL action commands are ignored
